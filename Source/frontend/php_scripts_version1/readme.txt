This contains two php script files named "table_create.php" - which is for creating product table when any new seller/customer registered for first time in indrakart/opencart . It will create a empty table with same structure as that of opencart "oc_product table" (in my case (oc_ssadproduct)) , the next it contains "update_product_table.php" which is for syncronising offline db of sellers with that of opencart's . In this i assume that opencart contains max of 10^6 sellers and make scripts according to that also i assume that indrakart will give all its good's (of each type (id) ) quantity to sellers .
